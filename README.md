# Final-project--Group-8
We are planning to do a data analysis on crime rate across the different nations

Our questions towards our progress: 
	The trend for crime rate since 2000
	The factors have correlation with the crime rate
	Areas that have the highest crime rates
	The police forces within the areas
	Any important regulation policies that specific impacted on the crime rates 
	Any recommendations with reducing the policy
